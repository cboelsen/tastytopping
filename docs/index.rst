.. TastyTopping documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to TastyTopping's documentation!
========================================

So, you've done all that hard work creating your REST API using `Tastypie
<http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ on the server-side -
why would you want to have to do it all again on the client-side?

TastyTopping creates objects that behave similarly to django models, using your
self-documenting TastyPie REST API to create the object's attributes and
behaviour, in addition to retrieving the data. TastyTopping only needs 2 things
from you (3 if you're using authentication): The URL of the API, and the
resource name.

As a brief example:

::

    >>> factory = ResourceFactory('http://localhost/app_name/api/v1')
    >>> ex = factory.example(field1='name', field2=10)
    >>> ex.field3 = datetime.now()
    >>> print ex.field4
    1.234

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following needs to be installed locally to run TastyTopping:

- Python 2.7+ or Python 3.3+

- requests (`link <http://requests.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_) >= 1.0.0


Tested with / against:

- django >= 1.5.0

- django-tastypie >= 0.9.14

- requests >= 1.0.0

(see the `tox.ini
<https://github.com/cboelsen/tastytopping/blob/master/tox.ini>`_ file for
more information).


Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Why another one? There are some other packages around that do something similar
(most notably tastypie-queryset-client), but they're lacking in a few areas:

- Python3 support

- Support for authentication

- Development has stagnated (none of them have released in close to a year,
  whereas tastypie has been releasing thick and fast).

- I found the interfaces clunky (although that's probably personal preference).

- Making another one was FUN!


Examples
^^^^^^^^

The examples shown here relate to the following TastyPie Resources:

::

    class UserResource(ModelResource):
        class Meta:
            resource_name = 'user'
            queryset = User.objects.all()
            allowed_methods = ['get']
            authorization = Authorization()
            filtering = {
                'username': ALL,
                'id': ALL,
            }

    class ExampleResource(models.ModelResource):
        created_by = fields.ForeignKey(UserResource, 'created_by', null=True)
        class Meta:
            resource_name = 'example'
            queryset = Example.objects.all()
            list_allowed_methods   = ['get', 'post']
            detail_allowed_methods = ['get', 'post', 'put', 'delete']
            authentication = ApiKeyAuthentication()
            authorization = Authorization()
            filtering = {
                'title': ALL,
                'rating': ALL,
                'date': ALL,
                'created_by': ALL_WITH_RELATIONS,
            }
            ordering = ['rating', 'date']

The following example shows basic usage of the ORM, that will use GET, PUT,
POST, and DELETE methods on the API, using the
:py:class:`tastytopping.factory.ResourceFactory`

::

    from datetime import datetime
    from tastytopping import TastyFactory, ApiKeyAuth

    if __name__ == "__main__":

        auth = ApiKeyAuth('username', '35632435657adf786c876e097f')
        factory = ResourceFactory('http://example.api.com:666/test/api/v1/', auth)

        new_resource = factory.example(title='A Title', rating=50)
        new_resource.date = datetime.now()

        # Get any user from the list of users and set it to created_by:
        user = factory.user.get(limit=1)
        new_resource.created_by = user
        # Get the new resource by its title:
        another_resource = factory.example.get(title='A Title')
        # Delete the new resource:
        new_resource.delete()
        # This will raise an exception
        print another_resource.date


Running The Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install tastytopping:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/cboelsen/tastytopping
    $ cd tastytopping
    $ virtualenv env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -U -r requirements.txt

And to run the tests:

::

    # Continued from above
    $ pip install tox
    $ tox

The tests are run against several environments with different versions of the
same packages, and are meant to pass all the tests at all times. If they aren't
passing, it's a `bug <https://github.com/cboelsen/tastytopping/issues>`_!
The tests aren't run against every combination of requests, django, and
tastypie supported, though, so there's a small chance a bug might slip in
unnoticed.
